## Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Customer Reviews
#### Overview
In this project, we'll build a classification system with a 3-way polarity(Positive, Negative, Neutral) to classify the customer 
reviews of Amazon's Grocery and Gourmet Food platform.

we'll first create a structured database from our raw data which is in an unstructured json format, preprocess it using <b>NLTK</b>
and then deploy <b>Naive Bayes classifier</b> to classify the reviews. we'll also compare the performance of our model against <b>Decision trees</b>
and <b>Support Vector Machines</b>.

#### Data
- The dataset has been taken from Amazon Review Data, Julian McAuley UCSD.
- We have taken 5k customer reviews with ratings on the scale of 1-5.
