I initially bought PG Tips and could never make a cup of hot tea that did not have a bitter after taste.  I thought it was my brewing technique until I tasted better teas.

I make red curry dishes frequently and always used Thai Kitchen brand. But the teeny jars were not to my liking and I wasn't crazy about their green curry. The Mae Ploy red is super, but it was the green that's our new favorite.

I used it for the first time last week when I was preparing dishes for a private-chef client who's on a low, low carb diet for his recently diagnosed diabetes 2 and wanted to make him something punchy and flavorful. Not only did he love the dish, but he gave some to his mother-in-law (who's also diabetic) and she loved it, too. My husband cruised by the kitchen when I was cooking, intrigued by the delicious aromas and was disappointed that it was for Bruce and not for us. So over the weekend, I made green curry halibut and shrimp ""burgers,"" and they were such a success I'm making the same thing for Bruce's wife who's a pescatarian; the first dish featured chicken thighs..

I appreciate that Mae Ploy uses all real ingredients in their curry paste and the generous amount in the package means I don't have to go through lots of little jars. The heat level is perfect. It's hotter than the red, but not so spicy that you can't taste the other flavors in the dish. And if you can't tell that I'm all about the green curry right now, I'm using it again tonight in a pork and vegetable dish for company. We eat a paleo diet with lots of vegetables and with some coconut milk and few other additions to the curry paste plus some meat or seafood, I can make a healthy dish with huge flavors that's easy to prepare.

Manufacture date: August 8, 2016
Expiration date: August 8, 2018
(Received order Feb. 2017)
Arrived before expected arrival date in good condition.
The green  paste comes in a clear, heavy, non- resealable plastic bag inside a heavy white plastic container. I put the paste in a ziplock baggie and back inside the container to store in the fridge.
The instructions are in English but the amount to be used is in grams, not teaspoons, tablespoons or ounces (for U.S.) The weight of the contents are in both ounces and grams. I did some math and used about 1/8 of the paste. It was a bit strong so I might lessen the amount a bit. I only had ""light"" coconut milk, so I imagine that using regular coconut milk would make it more creamy.
It is a product of Thailand. It contains no fat or sugar, 10 calories per 2 teaspoons (10 grams), sodium 610 mg., 2 grams carbohydrate, 1 gram fiber.
There is no MSG, preservatives or artificial colors.  Ingredients are listed.
You will need to add meat, chicken or seafood, if desired, vegetables, 1-1/2 cups coconut milk, water and 1-1/2 teaspoons sugar.

You need to experiment with the amount you use for the amount of heat you want.  I use a heaping table spoon (silverware, not a measuring spoon) of the curry paste for one standard size can of coconut milk, and about a pound of meat or shrimp.  It's hot, but not crazy hot.  I tried 2 heaping tbl spoons the last batch, and it was way too hot for me.

I suggest using a simple soy marinade on your meats, and I give a partial stir fry to mine, to give it a little color, before adding it to my curry mixture. Gives the meat better flavor I think as the curry doesn't have time to penetrate it.  I use light coconut milk, so I let it reduce to thicken up before I turn off the heat.

For those going for authenticity - with this paste, non-emulsified coconut milk, Thai apple eggplant, Thai pea eggplant, fish sauce, palm sugar, kaffir lime leaves and Thai basil you can make a beautiful curry with a signature oily green finish that served over quality Jasmine rice will have your Thai friends smile and nod in appreciation.

Aside from all the literal time, sweat and tears that go into making an incomparable green curry paste from scratch, the only store bought green curry paste I may rate higher than this is Nittaya brand, for one reason only - in comparison Mae Ploy green curry paste has a higher salt content.  This both limits the balancing that can be done to add the wonderful umami flavour of a quality fish sauce, and it also may make a curry too salty for those who are more health conscious or who are used to low sodium diets.

The other factor I'll mention is chili heat only because it has come up in other reviews.  It may be that batches vary in heat content, but for those who are used to Thai spice levels this paste has a very moderate spice level at what I would call a weak to average medium - a slow, sustained heat that comes on surprisingly quickly but which stays at a constant, pleasant burn without peaking into discomfort.

581,5.0,False,"11 5, 2013",AZKRFNQ8EFO4T,9742356831,Mike W.,"I have two things in mind when I make a Thai curry: 1) I want it to taste good and 2) I want whomever I'm making it for to feel like it's fairly authentic. Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.

A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:

1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.

2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.

3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with ""lite"" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.

This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper).","Authentic, easy, and delicious!",1383609600,39,,

My experiences with beef jerky were limited to the leathery stuff you buy in convenience stores. My first concern about using ground beef was safety. My Snackmaster dehydrator dries at a high enough temp that that was no longer a concern.
My second concern was taste. What on earth would ground beef jerky taste like? So, hesitantly, I bought extra-lean ground beef, and used the seasoning packets that came with the ""jerky gun.""
If you've ever used a press, you are going to LOVE how easily this thing makes jerky that's uniform and attractive. (Okay, I know most folks don't care what it looks like so long as it's good, but *I* care.) The only criticism I could have of this is that it doesn't hold very much at a time, so I would have to stop and refill it. But this is so easy to use, I was still done in no time.
Several hours later, the jerky was dried. I took a smaller piece out of the tray and nibbled on it. Hey, this stuff's great! Really tasty!
Once you've used up your seasoning packets, you can find kits online at various camping/hunting stores, or you can experiment and make your own. This is so simple, and so good... and you save so much money making it yourself. (That store-bought ick works out to at least [money]/pound.)

The gun was easy to use, and made perfectly shaped pieces of jerky.  I used extra-lean ground beef and the Original seasonings packet that came in the kit.

Pros:

-Gun easy to use, attachments super easy to figure out.

-Seasonings & cure come in little single-use packets, no measuring here!

-Choice of attachment sizes (flat strips, small or large round sticks).

-Cleans up easy in the dishwasher, just make sure the small pieces don't fall on the drying element.

-Makes GREAT tasting jerky, and dries perfectly in around 6 hours (I used the Nesco FD-50 dehydrator).

Cons:

-I had to reload the gun 3 times to go through a pound of ground beef mixture.  Not a really big deal, but does get a little messy.

-The gun doesn't squeeze the last little bit of meat through the circular attachments.  A chopstick works well for pushing out the excess meat the gun doesn't get.

The one problem I have with the jerkey Kit is that it is too small, you get less than 1/2 lb of meat per load, so you have to load the gun at least twice, usually 3 times per pound of meat.

I've been using Biotene Gum (and toothpaste) for almost 6 years now. As soon as I pop in a piece and crunch for the first time, my mouth enzymes respond with RELIEF!

If you've never had chronic dry mouth, you have no idea how horrible it is. Since so many medications now create this as a side effect, it's wonderful to have products that combat it.

I always have some next to my bed as well as in my purse, because it even helps when I wake up with a mouth like the Kobi Desert. Be careful not to go to sleep chewing, tho, because the pieces are small and can be swallowed easily.

I shipped several boxes of this to a friend in England with mouth cancer, and it gave him immediate relief, as well.

I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.

Oh yes, it's true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly couldn't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I'm not about to start now!

You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.

The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.

Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It's not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.

The gum is boring and small and doesn't retain flavor or the texture I like, so I don't chew it very long when I use it. I don't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra.  It's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I'm not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth.

This is a lively tasting fresh tea that has a clean and non bitter aftertaste.  It is spicy with a nice finish.  It has Eucalyptus, Fennel and Licorice root which help out in breathing.  Licorice root is also a great thing to use for upset stomachs.  It has Bi Yan Pian extract which is a chinese blend of different herbs that assist in clearing the passage ways for better breathing as well. It includes peppermint which also is good for opening up the air passages.

As with ANY herbal item, it is not regulated by the FDA.  Some of the herbal industry is flat out a scam with fat burning pills, hair growth serums and other items that really don't work.  For this item though I have found the tea to be safe and of good quality.

Remember though to let your Doctor know that you are taking it.  licorice root can react to some medications and it's important that you take seriously anything that you put into your body that has to do with your health.  Do research on your own as well.

The way my girlfriend takes it, is to use it at night for a relaxing wind down drink which will open up her breathing, especially during allergy season when she struggles.  This allows her to sleep more comfortably.  She also sometimes has it in the morning if her allergies are acting up some.  It has really helped her out and allowed her to have more comfortable breathing days, especially during those rough spring and summer allergy days.

Pro's:
-quality ingredients
-natural products that help breathing
-it really works.
-cost

Con's:
-as with any herbal item, let your doctor know what is in it
-remember it's not to be used in place of medications; be smart.
-may not be enjoyable to drink in summer months hot; make iced tea out of it but keep drinking it when you want or need to.

Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.

My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my ""real"" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!

Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods.",Great for Handpresso!,1328486400,2,,{'Flavor:': ' Espresso'}

I decided to order the Arabica version this time. The espresso got the same creamy look as the classic pods but missing the fragrance. The taste is a little bitter than what I like and not as smooth as the classic espresso pods. I checked the other reviews and found that there were a couple complaints about expired coffee. I went back to check and surely enough, my box was expired in July 2007. I requested a replacement and got a new shipment within 2 days (I am a prime member and they shipped with the next day service). Interestingly, the new box has the same batch number and the same expiration date. I requested for another shipment and this time the customer representative came back and said ""there was a problem with the expiration date.""

The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.
Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.

I was hesitant initially to give this one a try, having tasted a variety of other energy bars over the past few years, some good, some dreadful. I liked the sounds of this one and the fact it's made from real fruit with no additional sweeteners or artificial colors and flavors. So I decided to try it. I am glad I did. While I don't see this becoming a regular staple in my daily diet, it is great for the occasional pick-me-up when I am lagging on energy.

It has a strong berry flavor which pleasantly surprised me. The texture takes some getting used to however. I wasn't quite sure what to expect so the taffy-like consistency was a surprise. Actually, that made it even better for me. I felt like I was indulging in a rare treat but without the guilt. I could see myself trying out the other flavors of fruit smoothie bars and see if they taste as good as this one did.

Flavor: The predominant flavor is apples and cinnamon, with a persistent banana undertone, as well as tastes of raisin.  While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.

Texture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.

1346,5.0,True,"06 25, 2013",AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00006BN4U,Tucker Andersen,"The Original PowerBar Performance Energy Bar was one of the first nutritiously sound energy sources developed for performance oriented athletes but is now also used by a wide range of fitness enthusiasts and others interested in a nutritionally sound energy source. It is much more beneficial than candy bars or other sugar based snacks and much more convenient than fruit or other sources of carbohydrates. The company is often one of the sponsors of athletic events and distributes their products to the competitors.

I am a middle of the pack marathoner and long distance runner who originally carried a few candy bars with me but found that the initial sugar surge had little lasting benefit. When the PowerBar was introduced I decided to test its use instead and have been very pleased. The have continually expanded the number of flavors, so you should experiment until you find one that meets your taste requirements. My favorite is probably malt nut, followed by peanut butter. I find the chocolate a little rich for heavy, sustained exercise but good for less strenuous exercise or a snack. The company subsequently has also introduced several line extensions,including a Harvest Bar alternative with a somewhat different composition and different taste characteristics. My wife and daughter, who are bicyclists, both prefer the Harvest Bar. We have tried many of the numerous competitive alternatives introduced over the years, but have found PowerBars to be superior for a nutritious energy boost where quick caloric intake is important. The are also a good snack when traveling or skipping a meal.

The various flavors have slightly different nutritional composition, e.g. the Peanut Butter bar has a 1/3 higher fat content than the chocolate one. So check the labels of the individual flavors and don't assume that the ingredients are all identical except for the flavoring., and don't

My suggestion is that if you plan to use them in a competitive sports event or during strenuous exercise, try one first while training to make sure that it doesn't bother your digestive system. And check several different flavors, e.g. the caramel cookie is too sweet for me, but if you have a sweet tooth you may really like it. And don't eat them without some fluid intake to aid in their digestion. I got used to eating them while on easy training runs, and found out that I digested them most easily if I ate approximately a third of a bar every half hour. Finally, when I exercise in hot humid conditions, I chill them in the refrigerator first to help maintain their consistency.

If you want a somewhat lighter and easier to digest product for an energy boost, I recommend the Powerbar Energy Blasts, a gel like product which is very lightweight easy to carry with you and is very easy to digest. Not as many calories, but I still find helpful to my energy level especially in distance shorter than the marathon. I like the lemon the best, and the raspberry also although it is a little sweeter.

NOTE: this is an excellent price for a box of 24 Powerbars. Most grocery stores and other web sites offer these in smaller quantities  so be careful of comparison shopping. The only disadvantage is that you are purchasing a large quantity of one flavor, so make sure that you like it.

True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.

Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.

Overall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish.",all right by me !!!,1365638400,8,,"{'Size:': ' Pack of 12', 'Flavor:': ' Mixed Berry Blast'}"

I managed to hold on to my job thanks to the Gene Eden VIR 101 product which was given to me by my friend in the US. He himself is using it to combat latent chronic viral infection which results to lesser efficacy of the body's immune system. I am recovering fairly well after taking Gene Eden as my regular supplement but I wanted to perform the previous activities I enjoyed doing like regular gym work-outs and long walks in the park. Ever since I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome I was limited by my doctor to do strenous activities but with the aid of Gene Eden I feel long lasting boosting energy flowing through my blood stream.

I tried to combine Power Bar with one of my walks in the park and I was amazed how it kept my energy level high. I believe the electrolytes contained in these energy bar is sufficient to keep the cells of my body going.

1416,3.0,False,"07 11, 2008",AS6SH2JM2YY3H,B00006BN4U,R S Cobblestone,"Me, I'm generally a big fan of PowerBars.  I don't look at them as ""power bars,"" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.

PowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (""Berry Blast"" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.

I shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a ""fruity gum"" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.

The consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.

There were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.

My biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this ""fruit smoothie"" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.

So for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating"" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.

FOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.

  The specifics...
All the colors are mostly heavily pigmented. I wish they complemented each other more. It almost feels like the pink, and orange and ""blue"" (which seems like there is a bit of purple in there) are a bit neon. The red and yellow are primary along with the dark green. To me, the green is out of place, it should have been a lighter shade, perhaps a lime green.
 Taste: well, no real top points here! They are not sweet, nor do they taste like cocoa. They remind me of fondant. But, I am using them for the color not the culinary experience. And mixed in with the Ben and Jerry's Ice cream no one complained.
  They are very easy to use, each compartment has a separate cover, just flip and shake. :)
 For you bakers, I would think this could be used to decorate at least a dozen sugar cookies.

1512,4.0,False,"11 1, 2014",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00006FMLY,Sneaky Burrito,"I have a huge collection of sprinkles.  I wanted to use some today and was surprised to find I hadn't even opened this particular assortment (the animals and stars one, since there are multiple items on the same page), so of course these were the ones I had to use.

I think these are really cute.  I used the stars on some chocolate cupcakes today but am now trying really hard to think of something to do with the cows.  The picture on the item page is an accurate reflection of what you'll get and is also fairly reflective of the size.

These taste vaguely sugary and have a lot of artificial colors in them.  I figure, you're only using a small amount on any one baked item, so it won't hurt me to consume small quantities.  My experience is that, if you plan to store your baked goods for more than a couple of days, the color does start to bleed out (while I hadn't opened this assortment, I had a different Wilton assortment with similar ingredients that I'd experienced this with), especially with light-colored frostings.  (I always make my own frosting with butter, powdered sugar, and milk.  I can't say for sure that the bleeding color would happen in canned frosting.)

These don't necessarily distribute evenly because the shapes are rather large and tend to clog up the holes in the shaker.  If this happens, just turn the shaker right side up again and bang it on the counter and you should be good to go.  On one batch of 12 cupcakes, I used about 1/3 of the stars.  So you should be able to get at least a couple of uses out of each shape, making these well worth the cost.","these are fun, even for adults",1414800000,3,,{'Design:': ' Animals & Stars'}

I bought this product after many batches of trying to color melting chcolate wafer chips using regular store bought water based food coloring. I learned later on after browsing baking blogs that how we know water and oil doesn't mix, well chocolate and water doesn't mix either. All the food coloring I've been previously using was water based. So I bought the Wilton Primary Candy Color Set because it's oil based, and also on the Wilton site, they said this is the product to use if you wanted to color your melting chocolate wafer chips. Little did I know at the time, I thought after coloring separate bowls of white melted chocolate using the different colors of the food coloring, I thought my end result would be many different colors I could dip my cakepops,pretzels,oreos,etc in, but I was disappointed when all the bowls of white chocolate seized up and quickly becamed difficult to manage, so basically unusable. I trashed all the bowls of chocolate. My family always look to me when it's a birthday party,celebration,etc to make all the sweet baked goods-cupcakes,cakepops,pretzels,oreos,various flavor cookies,brownies,etc. I hope this review could help someone in the future!",I know I'll have amazing results after using the Wilton Primary Candy Color Set!,1410825600,,,{'Color:': ' Primary'}

Second, this frosting tastes odd; it does NOT have a delicious butter cream frosting taste to it. However, it is wonderful because it is MUCH stiffer than normal butter cream, which if you make it with all butter will just slide right off a cupcake if it gets warm. I make my butter cream frosting by using 1/3 butter, 1/3 Wilton's, and 1/3 Crisco, then just follow the normal recipe. (Usually, that means 2-3 cups of powdered sugar, and about 1 Tablespoon of liquid, be it milk, cream, water, etc. I am VERY sparing on the liquid, for structural purposes).

However, all of the tins were in perfect undented condition ( purchased directly from Amazon.com ) in a ""Ready-To-Ship"" box, tucked inside another box with plastic bubbles padding it, and the tin I opened to try held absolutely no broken cookie wafers whatever..not a one!

The taste is just wonderful, too, and the familiar flakey crisp of the wafer roll is simply perfect, but I was particularly pleased with the really rich semi-solid ( but still soft ) deep dark chocolate filling!

The reason I only gave it four stars is because there were many broken cookies even though they were well packaged and the metal container was undamaged. Could they be factory seconds?

I ordered a second carton of tins 4/18. When I unpacked the box, I noticed that a couple tins had somewhat loose plastic security strips around the tops of the containers. For one of those, I was able to completely remove the top of the tin and replace it without cutting the strip, and looking at it, you would never think that the top had been taken off. If this hadn't been in a sealed carton, I would have been extremely concerned about possible tampering, but there was no evidence of that when I examined the packets of cookies.

""Quote from a reviewer:
The sheer amount of platform games this holiday season is truly uncanny. With the likes of Sly Cooper, Mario, Ratchet and Clank, and Blinx the platform fans are sure to have their fills this x-mas. Midway has decided to join the action with it's quirky title Dr. Muto. A bizarre game about a mad scientist that can morph into creatures after compiling their DNA structure. While this is a truly unique concept, not not original, can this game survive amongst the larger and more widely known characters fighting for your platforming buck? The answer is a resounding yes and even in some way Muto exceeds their efforts. Let's take a look at another perfect example of an underground hit shall we?
Graphics
Visually this game is beautiful, large environments sporting some of the most unique architecture this side of Tim Burton. Very organic in it's look and design Muto's worlds are chock full of amazingly animated enemies and colorful hazards such as toxic sludge. The frame rate is as smooth as ice and the animations are flawless. From Muto's outrageous victory dances to the enemies scattering when being trapped this game has style to match it's unique look and feel. The only downsides are a lack of super textures, the ones here are damn good but could be better, and some nice XBox touches like reflections and bump mapping. All in all an absolutely gorgeous game.
Sound
Having memorable music is a must in a platform game, you can still hear the Mario theme in your head can you not? Dr. Muto comes across pretty standard in the department. With some typical techno beats mixed with peculiar sound effects the fare seems to drive the game forward, yet it fails to excel or leave anything for you to hum along with. The sound effects on the other hand are top notch, creepy sounds of cockroaches, putrid sounds of liquid and waste, mixed with some excellent voice acting add to the strange personality this game portrays. Dr. Muto himself muttering his ""sometimes"" understandable lingo to Al your personal computer with his monotone jokes about how the current situation is suitable for a videogame but not a mad scientist are of the highest quality.
Gameplay
This is where the game draws you in and doesn't let go. You are in control of Dr. Muto, a mad scientist with the ability to morph into creatures to accomplish goals. Sounds like a simple concept but the best part is the game does it so well by teaching you only what you need to know thus perfecting your skills for the later levels. You use the X button to perform what is called trapping, by trapping so many of the same creature you are given the ability to morph into it. This adds depth and personality and requires you to learn each function continuing to add more game for your buck. The game also switches styles on you from time to time adding challenge and variety, the screen often flips to the side for some old school 2D side scrolling action. Making jumps and timing are key to these challenges and continue to excel this game further in this department. While easy to pick up and taking a good amount of time to master Muto has certainly been designed with gamers in mind!
Overall
What this game does it does well and that is deliver a truly unique and fun experience for gamers. If you are a fan of platforming games and are tired of the same old crap then definitely pick this masterpiece up. It will deliver to you many hours of gaming goodness on top of being just downright entertaining to play. Watching this game is almost as fun as playing it and that is a feat less and less achieved in the gaming realm these days. I suggest giving this sleeper a rent, it may mutate your thoughts on platforming games in general. Highly recommended!

Highly recommended!"" 8.5 out of 10 by most reviewers.

Coffee, in my opinion has always been nasty, bitter, never enjoyable, certainly not good tasting! I drink it because I NEED it to wake up, not because I like it.  I won't even waste sugar or expensive creamers in coffee, why try to make it something its not? I just swallow the bitter pill and get on with my mornings!  However, THIS CUP of coffee changed all that.  It was delicious! I was shocked.  I never knew coffee could taste like this. I drank it down and ordered another cup. I also asked the waitress for the name of this incredible brew....she wrote it down for me. It was Douwe Egberts, she told she thought Wal-Mart sold it. Boo! :(  Deal breaker for me! It takes MUCH more than a cup of coffee to make me need anything badly enough to go into a Wal-Mart!  And now that Wal-Mart has gotten so ""PC"" with their refusal to make a confederate flag cake, but DID make an ISIS flag cake....I was more than happy to add them to my growing list of corporations we are boycotting! lol Corporations need to stay out of politics and personal, moral decisions, IMO.  (Forgive my ranting, I know I am only rating a coffee!)
To get to my point, I remembered today that Amazon sells groceries...and I am happy to see they sell my new favorite brand of coffee! I am ordering some today and look forward to enjoying it very soon, cuz Amazon ALWAYS delivers quickly! Try it! Its not just another cup of coffee...it will take your mornings to a whole new level!

Any of you buying this gum by the box surely knows exactly what I am talking about when I say this gum is so very inconsistent in flavor from pack to pack. One pack may be minty with a hint of sweet. The next pack, sometimes from the very same box, may be super sweet with no hint of mint, and the next 5 packs can be anyplace in between.

For whatever reason, there's absolutely *NO* consistency to the flavor of this gum, no matter where you buy it. If you want consistency, don't get it.

On the other hand, it's the only gum like it. It's very low carb, it's got a mild taste that's not overpowering. It's got an interesting ability to sooth some stomach and heartburn issues (regardless of which taste you got in the ""Sweet Mint"" pack).

And, as long as you like sweet, mint, or better (the rare times you find such a pack), ""sweet mint"" (as the name implies is what you're getting), you'll love it too...

...all while also hating it for its haphazard flavor consistency.

I've bought boxes of this, and will continue to. But, I can't rate it the 5 stars it should get when it's like I am getting a different flavor in every box.","I *LOVE* and *HATE* this gum, but will keep buying *boxes* of it! (SWEET MINT)",1506902400,,,{'Flavor:': ' Sweetmint'}

We get all the Orbit flavors they offer on Amazon.  This is the only flavor which seems to have this problem.  We have ordered it multiple times (thinking perhaps it was a bad batch or had a transit issue) and experienced the same issue.

For some reason the Orbit Bubblemint gum dissolves in your mouth within 5-10 minutes (multiple people have tried it with the same result).  It becomes a nasty slimy goo in a matter of minutes.  I don't know if the issue is with the gum recipe or what gets shipped through Amazon Prime is older or it gets too hot or cold in shipment - - whatever the reason, it dissolves in a matter of minutes into a nasty mush in your mouth.

Gum disease hits many of us. I had surgery about 15 years ago with root planing and scaling on 3 of my 4 mouth quadrants. The only quadrant which did not need to be peeled and scaled was where I had parked (think baseball player storing his ""chaw"") my xylitol gum for 30 years when I was making sales calls.

Now that once again I am undergoing additional periodontal maintenance, I decided to decrease the bacteria in my mouth by inserting some xylitol laced gum. Strange thing is, when you check the labels of those old line gums which used to contain xylitol, it is no longer available - having been replaced by artificial sweeteners and chemicals. A quick Google search showed Orbit was still using xylitol. Many reviewers have mentioned that the flavor does not last long. I disagree. I chew this to keep my mouth wet while on the elliptical for 45 minutes and it still has flavor left at the end of my workout. I never found any gum with flavor retention longer than two hours or so.

I will edit this review if it seems that this gum is helping my overall mouth health. In the meantime, I am getting at least the placebo effect.

Incidentally, the price was about $1.50 less than buying directly from Orbit, and Prime got it delivered in two days!

WOW! Just checked to make sure that I had the spelling correct. Amazing properties of Xylitol which extend way beyond antibacterial qualities; See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol.

Orbit is definitely my favorite brand of gum.  I find that each piece keeps its flavor for at least an hour, and it doesn't get that dried-out, tacky feeling.  I suppose you could say that it stays moist, and doesn't really lose its texture.

I've chewed minty flavors for years, and then last year I got into the Cinnamon flavor.  All of those are great!  I ended up buying the bubblegum flavor simply because it was much less expensive, and I figured, ""why not?!""

I am really enjoying the flavor.  Bubblegum isn't a flavor I have very often.  It's sweet, too, which really satisfies my sugar tooth.  Plus, I like how when I have an open pack, my purse gets a sweet smell!

Overall, this was a great purchase.  You get two boxes, each of which has 14 pieces.  So, aside from just the sheer quantity of gum, I like that I have several layers of plastic wrap protecting the packs of gum.  Seriously.  I live in a climate that gets very hot and humid during the summer, and if my gum isn't protected, it gets all mushy and loses its flavor.  It gets ruined!  So, given that it will take me a while to use this whole thing, I'm very glad that each pack, and each box, is covered in cellophane and will last!

Overall:  I definitely recommend.  Especially with the subscribe & save pricing, you can't buy good-quality gum at a better price!

According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.

Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It's sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh. I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen.

It tastes alright at first, but easily loses it flavor, faster than any gum that I have tasted in awhile. The strawberry flavor doesn't last long, only a couple of minutes and quickly goes away. I really didn't feel that it could be a flavor I would want to continuous buy.

Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.

It doesn't happen to everyone, but to some people this gum has bad side affects. Don't worry, nothing is permanent, and if you've already consumed it and nothing happened, you're fine. It's just for some people, their body doesn't know how to process it properly, so short side affects are included. I'm not saying Orbit is at fault, because they have other excellent gum, but this did not go so well for me.

It contains and ingredient called Aspartame, which is a fake sager. To learn more, go to this website: [...]

When I ate it my lips got tingly, and my throat and tongue went numb. I also felt nauseous, had difficulty breathing and got a headache.

If you've previously had Mono, or have it now, it can either bring out the Epstein Barr virus,(The virus that causes Mono) or temporarily make it worse.

Also, if you have a muscle disease, you can temporarily experience muscle pain.

Just remember, check gum boxes for any fake sugars, and remember that this doesn't happen with everyone, it can be rare. And again I'm not blaming Orbit for this problem, as this gum tasted great, my body just didn't agree with it.

If you do have the symptoms, gargle and swish with salt water, drink a whole water bottle, and you should be fine within about half and hour.

2727,2.0,False,"09 24, 2003",A238V1XTSK9NFE,B0000A0BS5,Andrew Lynn,"Few things I'd like to point out:
1.  ""Espresso"" is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.
2.  The product description says ""Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!""  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:
Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.
Therefore, a ""Universal Grind"" is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.
3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as ""Starbucks Roast"" because the Austrians don't seem to care.
That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.
Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:
Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.
Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.
Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.",Not actually for use in espresso machines,1064361600,84,,

However, after comparing with a few very expensive bags of espresso ground coffee from Italy and France, I found this to be remarkably comparable to them in all respects. Each blend had its own distinct flavor characteristics, but I felt this was of the same quality and very similar to the Italian brand I had used in commercial espresso machines for many years.  I am not prepared to do a fully detailed taste analysis or comparison, but I find this faithfully reproduces a latt and cappuccino from an actual Starbucks. I used to drink espresso, latts, & cappuccinos from Starbucks almost daily (maybe 5 per week) for several years, and now I use this and two other brands in my selection of espresso coffees at home, saving a lot of money by now only seeing the inside (or drive-thru) of a Starbucks maybe twice a month, and only when I won't have access to my espresso machine at home for a good while.

They do not look at all like children's craft glitter, but have the overall effect of sparkle- and you add them to a moist/still tacky icing or frosting or they may not adhere.  An actual glitter shaped particle product would look less sophisticated on food- at least all the ones I've tried have.  These have no flavor, and they're basically transparent, not white like flakes of ""white-out"", so they show off the color of icing underneath.  I've used other brands (Ck is less careful about uniformity of particle size),  but Wilton is the best and always consistent year to year.  I've been using this product for over a decade, and I highly recommend it but if you're not sure if this will create the look you seek for a specific application, get a Wilton Yearbook magazine and see how the Wilton artists utilize the products in a variety of applications, because there are other types of edible sparkles and you may get some good ideas from the Wilton experts.  If you're trying to make un-iced sugar cookies, and want that decorative sugar look on top, you're actually seeking the sanding sugar, which, if you looked under a microscope, looks like an extruded spaghetti cut into short lengths, where this is basically small flat clear feather-light flake with reflective qualities.

2936,4.0,True,"12 11, 2012",A7YMD8MSOBO1I,B0000A1OEF,Sharon Beverly,"Cake sparkles are intended to give just that; a bit of twinkling color.  If used alone, the impact is subtle.  If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath.  I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies.  After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top.  The icing will hold them in place.  The two layers create a beautiful, richer look.  Think of a precious stone.  Without being cut properly, the stone won't sparkle.  But, with facets and light, it comes to life.  That's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing.  I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.

This is not a product that you can taste.  It's not sweet.  Its purpose is to complement your baked goods, unlike sanding sugars or sprinkles/jimmies.

I decided to try Wiltons spray and see it if worked.  Its certainly easy enough to use.. spray the pan and add your batter and bake.

I did follow someones suggestion on releasing the cake which was to take the cake out of the oven and let it sit untouched for ten full minutes... then I used a soft spatula to run along the sides between the cake and the pan.. and inverted the cake onto a plate. I tapped the bottom of the pan several times then gently lifted the pan.. and the cake came out perfect.  I made three cakes with three different pans using the same method.

It might be noted that I sprayed the pans quite liberally with the spray.

I can only base my review on what I experienced.. but it worked well for me both times... so I am giving it a thumbs up as it is working well with my bundt cake pans.

I hope this review was helpful for you.

I've bought this coffee three times since my original review and purchase.
I can NOT make better tasting expresso than when using this Gourmet  Pilon Coffee.
I've used every Lavazza roast I can find (my favorite until now) but when it comes to expresso this coffee beats it every time.
I have also used 4-5 ""special"" brands including ""cooperative"" coffee beans and again these beans simply make better expresso.

If I compare the beans side by side, these stand out out with a deep, rich, shiny color.
It's like a good cigar with a shiny coat.

When making cappuccino, I use Lavazza, if only because I've already bought it and second, because in the end, you are going to add milk anyway.
But it makes a very flavorful Cappuccino.

My only wish is that they would start selling the kilo (2.2 lbs) bags but in the meantime,
I will keep buying these 1 pound bags.
Outstanding flavor.
The aroma, texture and taste are just perfect.
Absolutely the very best.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Positively the very best coffee beans you can buy to make Cuban style Expresso.
I've been buying Lavazza coffee beans to make Capuccino in my own double boiler Coffee machine at home for some time now.
And I've perfected it to the point my family and friends love it and when we go out, we frequently find the capuccino at most restaurants is no longer as good.  However my expresso shots do not taste as good no matter how different I grind the beans or which Lavazza beans I use.
After experimenting with a few brands it dawned on me the answer was in front of me. Our family (from Cuba and Dominican Republic) has been making everyday expresso several times a day using Cuban style ground coffee inside of these two-chamber stove top aluminum expresso makers (everyone in my family has one or more). They use Bustelo or Pilon ground coffee.
I bought a pound of this stuff (whole grain) and I haven't looked back yet.
Whenever I open the bag it reminds me of the fantastic aroma of freshly ground coffee back in Havana when I was a child. (My dad roasted and sold coffee on the side when we were there and my aunt does that today when she can find it).

After grinding enough for a serving, and adding turbinado sugar, I found it tastes like real Cuban coffee in Miami does (Coffee in Cuba today is often ""cut"" with something else but that's another story).
Anyway, my only regret is that it only comes in 1lb bags instead of the 2.2 (1 Kilo bags).

I keep it roasted-fresh in the Airtight Airscape containers I bought here in Amazon like this one (good for 1 lb) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HUVTYTA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_108.
For the larger Lavazza kilo bags to keep my coffee beans fresh, I buy the larger ones http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GMSJ3MK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_72

I want to HAVE to put some cream and suger in my coffee for it to be tolerable.  The first thing I noticed upon tasting PILON is that it's VERY strong yet VERY smooth.  I can't say that for the Starbucks brand espresso...actually at all.  I still put cream and suger in my americano's but I use less water, more espresso, and less sugar and cream.  That's because the flavor of this coffee is SO perfect.

Living in Chicago it's easy to find good espresso's, as intelligentsia and metropolis make excellent coffee for the larger brands here, but nothing really compares to the smooth cuban like flavoring of PILON.

This is a world-class selection of spice mixes, and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family.  (Or yourself, if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup.)

Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, don't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It's a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)

Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.

I purchased those 4 bottles as I was very impressed with the reviews and decided to give it a shot.

Oh boy was I so pleased!

Chef Paul really got it spot on when he made one seasoning blend for vegetables, meat, poultry and seafood. They pretty much have the same main ingredients but each one has that extra couple of ingredients that makes what ever your having taste amazing! Today I thought I would try the Vegatable blend with my pasta w/pesto and OMG, did it taste so so good! I am so happy with the blends I got.

I get all my lunches at work from a diet centre so sometimes I am stuck with very boring choices. I decided to keep Poultry, Seafood and Vegetables in the office with me at all times and and will keep the Meat Magic at home for my steaks :)

UPDATE:- I just used the Meat Magic over the weekend and WOW! I put a generous amount on every new york strip before grilling along with coconut oil and clarified butter (ghee) and oh man it tasted amazing! I have done close to a hundred steaks with different seasoning and marinade and this has got to be the best so far!

However, if you like a hot cereal that is not sloppy mush and tastes best with salt on it, then this might be a good one to try.

Note that Bob's makes several different blends. I like them all, but I don't buy the one that has soy in it since I try to eat as little of that as possible. (The 6-grain has no soy.)

It's true that microwaving this cereal can cause a mess in the microwave if you are not careful. Just use a bigger bowl, stop and start it more than it says to, and keep an eye on it. Or else make it on the stove. It only takes a few minutes, lazy!

This cereal is great for making at work since the measurements are pretty forgiving and really all you need to know is 1:3 cereal:water so you can measure with anything. Just be sure to use a big enough bowl!

So for those who are whining about it spewing all over their microwave, I've found a solution.
First off, if at first you don't succeed, you don't write it off. I figured the bowl got too hot to fast, thus creating a heated surface that would cause the watery substance to boil over. ALL YOU GOTTA DO is set tht microwave power level to 7 (70%) and cook for 3 mins. Then you just let it cool down to eating temperature, and TADA! At least at my elevation it worked. NO MESS.

Secondly, I purchased this item to eat healthier. On first taste, my body/tongue was like: ""mmmmmmNOPE, nuh uh, you ain't gonna eat more of this.""  But upon further consumption, It got a little better every time. Typical of health foods.

So, for those who want to give up upon first try, just try again. I found mixing peanut butter in adds good protein and flavor. While those who just want a good breakfast that's a little sweeter can add the brown sugar.","Needs a little Flavoring, but is a super breakfast!",1394236800,3,,{'Size:': ' 24 Ounce (Pack of 4)'}

The others has a slight vitamin taste which doesn't bother me, but I just love peppermint. It tastes fantastic, each bite gives you the sweet minty taste with a bit of chocolate taste. I could gobble mine down in a few seconds and it's easy to chew which helps my teeth. Probably one of the best tasting out of the Luna and Cliff bars.

With that in mind, I have tried different peanut butters and have narrowed my preferences down to two brands, Maranatha being one.  My reasons:

-Organic: made with certified organic peanuts and if that is important to you, then Maranatha is a great choice.

-Additives: NO hydrogenated oils, NO sugar added; no nothing except for a tiny trace of salt.  But, this does not taste salty at all

-Great taste: This should have been first.  Maranatha has a mild, mellow, peanutty taste. I really do like it.

-Great texture: truly smooth and creamy. Easy to spread even on soft bread

Hint: This is NOT homogenized; the oil is on the top of the peanut butter when you open the jar.  You have to mix it in but, fear not!  Stick a butter knife down into the middle of the jar and move it ever so slightly, creating an opening into which the oil can flow.  Repeat this a few times and most of the oil will be gone from the top.  Stir and then enjoy.  You will NOT have to mix again.

This peanut butter seemed great at first glance - but be careful and read the label.  Maranatha makes several types of organic nut butters -- but the ""no stir"" type contains sugar and palm oil.

Granted, it's ""organic palm oil"", but the palm oil industry is guilty of horrific ecological atrocities, including the systematic genocide of endangered orangutans and decimation of rain forests. (If you google ""orangutans and palm oil"", it'll break your heart). And palm oil labeled ""green"" or ""organic"" is generally considered ""greenwashing"" - it's still grown in palm farms which have replaced vital rain forest -  so I'm skeptical.

Plus palm oil is not so good for our health. I'm surprised that Maranatha would include it.

Maranatha DOES makes a good quality, tasty organic peanut butter that is a better option than their ""no stir"" type.  It's delicious and has ""no additives, sweeteners, chemicals, preservatives or trans fats"" - and less ethical concerns too.

Some have lettering, some have a score line, some have absolutely nothing.  Since I divvy up my pills in one of those weekly boxes, it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish one pill from the other--so I thought of using this frosting spray.

I bought 9 colors of this Color Mist, and have made me a chart so I know which pill is which color.  It makes for a very festive pill box, but the important thing is that I can identify which pill is which.

I created a 'spray paint box' so as to not get the overspray all over the place, laid a piece of parchment paper (which I folded in half before placing in the box for ease of getting the pills back into their bottles), laid out the pills on the parchment, and LIGHTLY sprayed the pills.  All they need is a dusting of the color--enough to distinguish one from the other.  Dries practically instantly, and doesn't affect the pill at all.  Pick up the parchment, and with the crease as your 'funnel', slide the pills back in their bottle.  Repeat with any other pills you may be doing this with.

I have found that if you need more than the colors available, do one side in one color, turn the pills over, and do that side with another color.  Trying to ""blend"" the colors doesn't work....the 'canvas' is too small, the product has a wide spray, and in the end, they just look like some muddy color that you couldn't distinguish one from another.

It's a good product.....and on frosting, it's even prettier.  I know you can find this wherever Wilton products are sold--but they may not stock all the colors.

Someone steals your V-8 interceptor and then chases you in it across the wasteland with a bunch of shiny and chrome warboys in tow. Interestingly enough, every once in a while you find a warboy less insane than the others, leading to real friendships on the high desert. My best estimate is it gives you +2 luck to befriend a warboy, but +3 if he is carrying Wilton Silver or you give him yours. That is a real world 33% improvement for less than the cost of a grab bag of certified 80% dud 12 gauge ammo.

Can't confirm passage to Valhalla, but I've found having this product coating the inside of my mouth helps a bunch when I'm spitting gazzoline directly into any carburetor. I seem to be able to hold more per pull out of the gas bucket, and ingest less by accident.

However, the letters slide freely while in the holder and often just fall out completely.  Additionally, the spacing between letters varies depending upon which letter is chosen.  And another thing, the size of the letters is only appropriate for a smaller (9-12"") cake; they would look ridiculously small on anything larger. Also note that the letters are only capitals, no lowercase.  Lastly, there weren't enough repeat letters for me to complete even one line of text (not enough ""R""s), so I had to press each word separately, causing some spacing/alignment issues.

Most fondant presses are expensive and here was this set that could be used on both buttercream and fondant cakes.  I knew that it could be used on fondant covered cookies as well so I added these designs to my wardrobe-inspired cake and cookie decorating book.

The most important thing I can say is that you need to practice before you actually make your cakes or cookies.  It's important to get the right pressure the first time since it's very hard to get the press back in the same spot again.  On cookies, your fondant should not be thicker than 1/4"" (less than that and you don't have a clean imprint).

These presses can also be used to go around a cake (think miniature cupcake purses) or miniature cupcake hats.

I was looking at some of the other reviews before I started typing this because I was curious how they could be so negative.  (I hadn't read about this before buying--I just made the purchase at the suggestion of my teacher who, admittedly, is hawking Wilton products in a Wilton class.)  I have used the colors a few times now and they seem to work just fine.  I saw that people complained that the colors changed in the icing.  According to my Wilton cake book, that's common for these colors and you just need to let them sit for a few minutes before  frosting your cake because then they'll set and you'll know if you need to add more coloring, etc.  The colors are also very intense, so you only need to use a toothpick's full of color at a time or else the color will change really, really quickly.  Because you need such a small amount, these will actually last for a long time.  I hope this addresses some of the other comments that people had.  The colors are really quite vibrant and I like them. I only wish that black had been included in this pack.  I did use a classmate's black since she'd purchased the larger pack, but it turned the icing more of a grey-purple color.  (According to our cake book, it's best to get to black by starting with chocolate icing instead of white which is what I was using.)  One last comment, our instructor also said that these are better than the liquid food coloring because that type of coloring will thin frosting too much.

Since 0 isn't an option (and it should be), I'm rating this a 1.  But it doesn't even deserve that.

I just made a wedding cake for my best friend using the black and purple Wilton colors.  I needed just a touch of the black to make gray buttercream, and just a little purple for both my fondant and buttercream.  Both colors looked great when I applied them to the cake, but within minutes of being exposed to sunlight (even indirect sunlight), THEY CHANGED COLORS COMPLETELY!  My purple turned BLUE and my gray turned GREEN.  This is not acceptable.  I had no idea this change in color would occur and NO WHERE on the package does it say that colors may change with exposure to sunlight.  Even if I had kept it out of sunlight completely while I made it and stored it in complete darkness, it would eventually be exposed to sunlight when I went to transport it.  It changed within minutes of being exposed to the sun.

My friend's wedding is today and I have to somehow tell her that the colors we originally had are now blue and green instead of purple and gray... Not only did the buttercream change color, so did the fondant, and it is INCREDIBLY noticeable.

I'm so incredibly disappointed, and I seriously doubt the ability of Wilton to produce high-quality cake products.  Believe me, I'll never use any of their products ever again.

It tastes like soap that's been infused with dirty pennies someone fished out of the cracks between sidewalk pavers on a New York City street.

So, I had a nice fresh batch of beautiful homemade buttercream dyed a neon pink and totally ruined by this red dye.

This does what it's supposed to, it whitens up my frosting, and the research I did on it says that it's safe to use.

The only thing that doesn't seem to add up is, the instructions say it is to be used in small quantities.

I find that a small quantity (a teaspoon, for instance) of it doesn't make much of a dent, color wise, in a regular batch of my frosting.

It's also not clear why they tell you to use it in small quantities in the first place because I'd venture to guess it's used in large quantities in TONS of foods.

The brown makes a beautiful tan as a base for the other colors but if making a landscape a little more is a perfect deep brown for the trunk of a tree.  Colors can be easily mixed together to make different shades, like mixing pink and purple to make violet.

I have found toothpicks to be the best choice when adding colors to icing.  They make it much easier to get the right amount of coloring and its always easy to add more if needed, unfortunately you can't take it out if you add to much.",I always know that I will get a great product when I order Wilton,1453507200,3,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61paSuj5tlL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zE0T3gNtL._SY88.jpg']","{'Size:': ' Set of 8', 'Style Name:': ' 0'}"

The awesome thing is that the consistency of the gels do little to affect the consistency of the icing, but do a lot to color it. The problem with this set is that it is not the best way to get these icings. It is okay for someone who doesn't do a lot of decorating or who doesn't need a lot in these particular colors.

I used them to color the batter for a 6 layer 'rainbow' cake and everyone complimented me on how great it looked and how vibrant the colors were.  With these a little goes a long way!

I made a similar cake in pastel colors for Easter and I used some gel colorings by Wilton that came in squeeze tubes for that (NOT THESE).  While it worked great on the cake batter, when I used it to make some pink icing, I found that just a VERY short time in the sun bleached the color right out of the icing! (within 10 minutes, I noticed one side was brighter than the other, by the time we served the cake an hour later, you couldn't even tell it was pink anymore until you cut into it where you could see the inside of the icing was still pink).
